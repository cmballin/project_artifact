#Project Artifact

A personal project that is helping me get my coding back up to par while learning some .NET, WPF and XAML in the process.

The game uses the keyboard as a twister-like input device and forces the player to hold down sequences of keys in order to attack.

The goal is to make a skill based combat game which is fun at the input level. In other words, just queueing up an attack should be fun in it's own right, without having to worry too much about other motivators. The game is also foing to have an infinitely high curve of difficulty, so that any player can continue to fine tune their skills and improve. However, it should be possible to ramp up the difficulty to beyond human capability.
